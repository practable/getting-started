Documentation for new adopters of the system 

## Introduction

Welcome to the practable.io ecosystem, and thank you for taking the time to consider using our approach. We think you'll enjoy the benefits of our architecture. 

Our goal is to build a community of adopters and developers. We recognise support needs will vary, and have identified the following needs so far:

0.  provide a record of how to setup, configure and operate the system that is useful to the core developer team 
0.  support experienced linux systems administrators to adopt the system for themselves using exactly the approach we use
0. support experienced linux systems administrators to adopt the system for themselves on different platforms / with other integrations / modifications 
0. support less experienced adopters who wish to develop the capability to run the system themselves using exactly the approach we use
0. support less experienced adopters who wish to develop the capability to run the system themselves on different platforms / with other integrations / modifications 
0. support new adopters with no existing capability, spare capacity, or desire to run the system themselves (and would like it supplied as a service)

To date, we're doing a reasonable job of (0) and working on improving and making public the necessary tools & documentation to address (1). At this stage, we encourage all potential adopters to drop us a line at [RL.Eng@ed.ac.uk](mailto:RL.Eng@ed.ac.uk) so we can do a demo to help you triage your interest and discuss your plans/needs. 

## Configuring the cloud services

We'll add a note here when we've released our instance configuration documentation and scripts - please watch this repo for a notification.

Work is in progress on the dev branch of [practable/admin-tools](https://github.com/practable/admin-tools)
